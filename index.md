## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="IMG_3954-2.jpg">

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Political Science (major in American Politics, minor in Public Policy) from George Washington University. I obtained my Master of Arts from George Washington University in 2022 and Bachelor of Arts with Honors in Philosophy, Politics and Economics from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor in 2018.

## Research Interest

My research interests include Asian American politics, political representation, and race and ethnicity politics broadly. In my dissertation, I argue that the national-origin consciousness of the individuals is the driving force behind the co-national-origin preference, and it can be activated by discrimination, family history, and group pride. Using a range of survey experiments, I identify the conditions under which national-origin consciousness can be activated. Lastly, I apply the idea of national-origin consciousness to studying the role of national-origin in campaigns and elections.

Born and raised in Hong Kong, aside from American politics, I am interested in studying regulatory politics in the Greater China region. I collaborated with my coauthors on examining government responsiveness in public consultation in China. I am also working on several research projects concerning public consultations in Hong Kong and Taiwan. My work has appeared in *American Politics Research*, *George Washington University Regulatory Studies Center* [2x] and *USAPP - American Politics and Policy - The London School of Economics and Political Science*.
