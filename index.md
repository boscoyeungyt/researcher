## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="IMG_3954-2.jpg">

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Political Science (major in American Politics, minor in Public Policy) from George Washington University and a Predoctoral Research Associate at Princeton University under the supervision of [Professor Noel Foster](https://www.noelfoster.com). I obtained my Master of Philosophy (2023) and Master of Arts (2022) from George Washington University and Bachelor of Arts with Honors and distinction in Philosophy, Politics and Economics from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor in 2018.

## Research Interest

My research interests include Asian American politics, political representation, and race and ethnicity politics broadly. In my dissertation, I argue that the ethnic origin has an important role in Asian American politics. The first chapter of my dissertation (forthcoming at [JREP](https://doi.org/10.1017/rep.2023.35)) examines what ethnic origin means to Asian Americans by conducting interviews. Then, in the second chapter, using a range of survey experiments, I examine the receptiveness of Chinese and non-Chinese voters to Chinese candidates' language appeal. I find that the effectivness of language appeal on voting is conditional on the strength of ethnic origin consciousness of the Chinese voters. Lastly, in the third chapter, I demonstrate that ethnic origin identity of Asian Americans is tied to their ethnic media consumption. I also find that the consumption of ethnic news leads to divergent foreign policy attitudes among Asian Americans.

Born and raised in Hong Kong, aside from American politics, I am interested in studying regulatory politics in the Greater China region. I collaborated with my coauthors on examining government responsiveness in public consultation in China. I am also working on several research projects concerning public consultations in Hong Kong and Taiwan. My work has appeared in *The Journal of Race, Ethnicity, and Politics*, *American Politics Research*, *George Washington University Regulatory Studies Center* [2x] and *USAPP - American Politics and Policy - The London School of Economics and Political Science*.
